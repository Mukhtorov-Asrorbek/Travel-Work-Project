            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              In the following, you will find an overview of the legal basis of
              the GDPR on which we base the processing of personal data. Please
              note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data
              protection provisions of your or our country of residence or
              domicile may apply. If, in addition, more specific legal bases are
              applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the
              data protection declaration.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <ul role="list">
              <li>
                Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR) - The data subject has given
                consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or
                more specific purposes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b)
                GDPR) - Performance of a contract to which the data subject is
                party or in order to take steps at the request of the data
                subject prior to entering into a contract.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR) -
                Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation
                to which the controller is subject.
              </li>
              <li>
                Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR) - Processing is
                necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued
                by the controller or by a third party, except where such
                interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights
                and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of
                personal data.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data
              Protection Regulation, national regulations apply to data
              protection in Germany. This includes in particular the Law on
              Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing
              (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG
              contains special provisions on the right to access, the right to
              erase, the right to object, the processing of special categories
              of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission
              as well as automated individual decision-making, including
              profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for the
              purposes of the employment relationship (§ 26 BDSG), in particular
              with regard to the establishment, execution or termination of
              employment relationships as well as the consent of employees.
              Furthermore, data protection laws of the individual federal states
              may apply.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h2><strong>Security Precautions</strong></h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in
              accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the
              state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature,
              scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of
              varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of
              natural persons, in order to ensure a level of security
              appropriate to the risk.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the
              confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling
              physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to,
              input, transmission, securing and separation of the data. In
              addition, we have established procedures to ensure that data
              subjects' rights are respected, that data is erased, and that we
              are prepared to respond to data threats rapidly. Furthermore, we
              take the protection of personal data into account as early as the
              development or selection of hardware, software and service
              providers, in accordance with the principle of privacy by design
              and privacy by default.

              SSL encryption (https): In order to protect your data transmitted
              via our online services in the best possible way, we use SSL
              encryption. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the
              prefix https:// in the address bar of your browser.&nbsp;

            <h2><strong>Transmission of Personal Data</strong></h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              In the context of our processing of personal data, it may happen
              that the data is transferred to other places, companies or persons
              or that it is disclosed to them. Recipients of this data may
              include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks
              or providers of services and content that are embedded in a
              website. In such a case, the legal requirements will be respected
              and in particular corresponding contracts or agreements, which
              serve the protection of your data, will be concluded with the
              recipients of your data.

            <p>‍</p>
            <h2><strong>Data Processing in Third Countries</strong></h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European
              Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing
              takes place in the context of the use of third party services or
              disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, bodies or
              companies, this will only take place in accordance with the legal
              requirements.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              Subject to express consent or transfer required by contract or
              law, we process or have processed the data only in third countries
              with a recognised level of data protection, on the basis of
              special guarantees, such as a contractual obligation through
              so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission or if
              certifications or binding internal data protection regulations
              justify the processing (Article 44 to 49 GDPR, information page of
              the EU Commission:
              <a
                href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en"
                >https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en</a

            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h2><strong>Erasure of data</strong></h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              The data processed by us will be erased in accordance with the
              statutory provisions as soon as their processing is revoked or
              other permissions no longer apply (e.g. if the purpose of
              processing this data no longer applies or they are not required
              for the purpose).
            </p>
            <p>
              If the data is not deleted because they are required for other and
              legally permissible purposes, their processing is limited to these
              purposes. This means that the data will be restricted and not
              processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data
              that must be stored for commercial or tax reasons or for which
              storage is necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or
              to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              In the context of our information on data processing, we may
              provide users with further information on the deletion and
              retention of data that is specific to the respective processing
              operation.

            <h2><strong>Business services</strong></h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              We process data of our contractual and business partners, e.g.
              customers and interested parties (collectively referred to as
              "contractual partners") within the context of contractual and
              comparable legal relationships as well as associated actions and
              communication with the contractual partners or pre-contractually,
              e.g. to answer inquiries.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              We process this data in order to fulfill our contractual
              obligations. These include, in particular, the obligations to
              provide the agreed services, any update obligations and remedies
              in the event of warranty and other service disruptions. In
              addition, we process the data to protect our rights and for the
              purpose of administrative tasks associated with these obligations
              and company organization. Furthermore, we process the data on the
              basis of our legitimate interests in proper and economical
              business management as well as security measures to protect our
              contractual partners and our business operations from misuse,
              endangerment of their data, secrets, information and rights (e.g.
              for the involvement of telecommunications, transport and other
              auxiliary services as well as subcontractors, banks, tax and legal
              advisors, payment service providers or tax authorities). Within
              the framework of applicable law, we only disclose the data of
              contractual partners to third parties to the extent that this is
              necessary for the aforementioned purposes or to fulfill legal
              obligations. Contractual partners will be informed about further
              forms of processing, e.g. for marketing purposes, within the scope
              of this privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              Which data are necessary for the aforementioned purposes, we
              inform the contracting partners before or in the context of the
              data collection, e.g. in online forms by special marking (e.g.
              colors), and/or symbols (e.g. asterisks or the like), or
              personally.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              We delete the data after expiry of statutory warranty and
              comparable obligations, i.e. in principle after expiry of 4 years,
              unless the data is stored in a customer account or must be kept
              for legal reasons of archiving (e.g., as a rule 10 years for tax
              purposes). In the case of data disclosed to us by the contractual
              partner within the context of an assignment, we delete the data in
              accordance with the specifications of the assignment, in general
              after the end of the assignment.

              If we use third-party providers or platforms to provide our

            <p>
              Contractual partners can create a customer or user account. If the
              registration of a customer account is required, contractual
              partnerswill be informed of this as well as of the details
              required for registration. The customer accounts are not public
              and cannot be indexed by search engines. In the course of
              registration and subsequent registration and use of the customer
              account, we store the IP addresses of the contractual partners
              along with the access times, in order to be able to prove the
              registration and prevent any misuse of the customer account.
            </p>
            <p>
              If customers have terminated their customer account, their data
              will be deleted with regard to the customer account, subject to
              their retention is required for legal reasons. It is the
              responsibility of the customer to secure their data upon
              termination of the customer account.

              we use the services of one or more web hosting providers from
              whose servers (or servers they manage) the online services can be
              accessed. For these purposes, we may use infrastructure and
              platform services, computing capacity, storage space and database
              services, as well as security and technical maintenance services.

                E-mail Sending and Hosting: The web hosting services we use also
                include sending, receiving and storing e-mails. For these
                purposes, the addresses of the recipients and senders, as well
                as other information relating to the sending of e-mails (e.g.
                the providers involved) and the contents of the respective
                e-mails are processed. The above data may also be processed for
                SPAM detection purposes. Please note that e-mails on the
                Internet are generally not sent in encrypted form. As a rule,
                e-mails are encrypted during transport, but not on the servers
                from which they are sent and received (unless a so-called
                end-to-end encryption method is used). We can therefore accept
                no responsibility for the transmission path of e-mails between
                the sender and reception on our server.
              </li>
              <li>
                Collection of Access Data and Log Files: We, ourselves or our
                web hosting provider, collect data on the basis of each access
                to the server (so-called server log files). Server log files may
                include the address and name of the web pages and files
                accessed, the date and time of access, data volumes transferred,
                notification of successful access, browser type and version, the
                user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited
                page) and, as a general rule, IP addresses and the requesting
                provider. The server log files can be used for security
                purposes, e.g. to avoid overloading the servers (especially in
                the case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and to
                ensure the stability and optimal load balancing of the servers;
                Retention period: Log file information is stored for a maximum
                period of 30 days and then deleted or anonymized. Data, the
                further storage of which is necessary for evidence purposes, are
                excluded from deletion until the respective incident has been
                finally clarified.

                Content-Delivery-Network: We use a so-called "Content Delivery

                our online services, in particular large media files, such as
                graphics or scripts, can be delivered faster and more securely
                with the help of regionally distributed servers connected via
                the Internet.

              We process the data of the users of our application to the extent
              necessary to provide the users with the application and its
              functionalities, to monitor its security and to develop it
              further. Furthermore, we may contact users in compliance with the
              statutory provisions if communication is necessary for the
              purposes of administration or use of the application. In addition,
              we refer to the data protection information in this privacy policy
              with regard to the processing of user data.

              Legal basis: The processing of data necessary for the provision of
              the functionalities of the application serves to fulfil
              contractual obligations. This also applies if the provision of the
              functions requires user authorisation (e.g. release of device
              functions). If the processing of data is not necessary for the
              provision of the functionalities of the application, but serves
              the security of the application or our business interests (e.g.
              collection of data for the purpose of optimising the application
              or security purposes), it is carried out on the basis of our
              legitimate interests. If users are expressly requested to give
              their consent to the processing of their data, the data covered by
              the consent is processed on the basis of the consent.&nbsp;

                Device authorizations for access to functions and data: The use
                of certain functions of our application may require access to
                the camera and the stored recordings of the users. By default,
                these authorizations must be granted by the user and can be
                revoked at any time in the settings of the respective devices.
                The exact procedure for controlling app permissions may depend
                on the user's device and software. Users can contact us if they
                require further explanation. We would like to point out that the
                refusal or revocation of the respective authorizations can
                affect the functionality of our application.

                audio recordings are also included) of the users (and of other
                persons captured by the recordings) are processed by accessing
                the camera functions or stored recordings. Access to the camera
                functions or stored recordings requires an authorization by the
                user that can be withdrawn at any time. The processing of the
                image and/or video recordings serves only to provide the
                respective functionality of our application, according to its
                description to the users or the typical and expectable
                functionality of the application.

            <p>
              Single Sign-On" or "Single Sign-On Authentication or Logon" are
              procedures that allow users to log in to our online services using
              a user account with a provider of Single Sign-On services (e.g. a
              social network). The prerequisite for Single Sign-On
              Authentication is that users are registered with the respective
              Single Sign-On provider and enter the required access data in the
              online form provided for this purpose, or are already logged in
              with the Single Sign-On provider and confirm the Single Sign-On
              login via the button.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              Authentication takes place directly with the respective single
              sign-on provider. Within the scope of such authentication, we
              receive a user ID with the information that the user is logged in
              with the respective single sign-on provider under this user ID and
              an ID that cannot be used for other purposes (so-called "user
              handle"). Whether we receive further data depends solely on the
              single sign-on procedure used, the data releases selected as part
              of authentication and also which data users have released in the
              privacy or other settings of the user account with the single
              sign-on provider. Depending on the single sign-on provider and the
              user's choice, there can be different data, usually the e-mail
              address and the user name. The password entered by the single
              sign-on provider as part of the single sign-on procedure is
              neither visible to us nor is it stored by us.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              Users are requested to note that their data stored with us can be
              automatically compared with their user account with the single
              sign-on provider, but this is not always possible or actual. If,

            <h2><strong>Communication via Messenger</strong></h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              We use messenger services for communication purposes and therefore
              ask you to observe the following information regarding the
              functionality of the messenger services, encryption, use of the
              metadata of the communication and your objection options.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also contact us by alternative means, e.g. telephone or
              e-mail. Please use the contact options provided to you or use the
              contact options provided within our online services.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              In the case of encryption of content (i.e. the content of your
              message and attachments), we point out that the communication
              content (i.e. the content of the message and attachments) is
              encrypted end-to-end. This means that the content of the messages
              is not visible, not even by the messenger service providers
              themselves. You should always use a current version of the
              messenger service with activated encryption, so that the
              encryption of the message contents is guaranteed.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              However, we would like to point out to our communication partners
              that although messenger service providers do not see the content,
              they can find out that and when communication partners communicate
              with us and process technical information on the communication
              partner's device used and, depending on the settings of their
              device, also location information (so-called metadata).&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              Information on Legal basis: If we ask communication partners for
              permission before communicating with them via messenger services,
              the legal basis of our processing of their data is their consent.
              Otherwise, if we do not request consent and you contact us, for
              example, voluntarily, we use messenger services in our dealings
              with our contractual partners and as part of the contract
              initiation process as a contractual measure and in the case of
              other interested parties and communication partners on the basis
              of our legitimate interests in fast and efficient communication
              and meeting the needs of our communication partners for
              communication via messenger services. We would also like to point
              out that we do not transmit the contact data provided to us to the
              messenger service providers for the first time without your
              consent.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              Withdrawal, objection and deletion: You can withdraw your consent
              or object to communication with us via messenger services at any
              time. In the case of communication via messenger services, we
              delete the messages in accordance with our general data retention
              policy (i.e. as described above after the end of contractual
              relationships, archiving requirements, etc.) and otherwise as soon
              as we can assume that we have answered any information provided by
              the communication partners, if no reference to a previous
              conversation is to be expected and there are no legal obligations
              to store the messages to prevent their deletion.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              Reservation of reference to other means of communication: Finally,
              we would like to point out that we reserve the right, for reasons
              of your safety, not to answer inquiries about messenger services.
              This is the case if, for example, internal contractual matters
              require special secrecy or if an answer via the messenger services
              does not meet the formal requirements. In such cases we refer you
              to more appropriate communication channels.

            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              With the consent of the users, we can send the users so-called
              "push notifications". These are messages that are displayed on
              users' screens, devices or browsers, even if our online services
              are not being actively used.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              In order to sign up for push messages, users must confirm that
              their browser or device has requested to receive push messages.
              This approval process is documented and stored. The storage is
              necessary to recognize whether users have consented to receive the
              push messages and to be able to prove their consent. For these
              purposes, a pseudonymous identifier of the browser (so-called
              "push token") or the device ID of a terminal device is stored.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              The push messages may be necessary for the fulfilment of

              otherwise be sent, unless specifically mentioned below, on the

              respective browsers or end devices.

                Analysis and performance measurement: We statistically evaluate
                push messages and can thus identify if and when push messages
                were displayed and clicked on. This information is used for the
                technical improvement of our push messages based on technical
                data or target groups and their retrieval behavior or retrieval
                times. This analysis also includes determining whether the push
                messages are opened, when they are opened and whether users
                interact with their content or buttons. For technical reasons,
                this information can be assigned to individual push message
                recipients. However, it is neither our intention nor, if used,
                that of the push message service provider to monitor individual
                users. Rather, the evaluations serve to identify the usage
                habits of our users and to adapt our push messages to them or to
                send different push messages according to the interests of our
                users. The evaluation of the push messages and the measurement
                of performance are based on the consent of the users, which is
                given with their permission to receive the push messages. Users
                can object to the analysis and performance measurement by
                unsubscribing from the push messages. Unfortunately, it is not
                possible to cancel the analysis and performance measurement
                separately.

              We use platforms and applications of other providers (hereinafter
              referred to as "Conference Platforms") for the purpose of
              conducting video and audio conferences, webinars and other types
              of video and audio meetings (hereinafter collectively referred to
              as "Conference"). When using the Conference Platforms and their
              services, we comply with the legal requirements.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              Data processed by Conference Platforms: In the course of
              participation in a Conference, the Data of the participants listed
              below are processed. The scope of the processing depends, on the
              one hand, on which data is requested in the context of a specific
              Conference (e.g., provision of access data or clear names) and
              which optional information is provided by the participants. In
              addition to processing for the purpose of conducting the
              conference, participants' Data may also be processed by the
              Conference Platforms for security purposes or service
              optimization. The processed Date includes personal information
              (first name, last name), contact information (e-mail address,
              telephone number), access data (access codes or passwords),
              profile pictures, information on professional position/function,
              the IP address of the internet access, information on the
              participants' end devices, their operating system, the browser and
              its technical and linguistic settings, information on the
              content-related communication processes, i.e. entries in chats and
              audio and video data, as well as the use of other available
              functions (e.g. surveys). The content of communications is
              encrypted to the extent technically provided by the conference
              providers. If participants are registered as users with the
              Conference Platforms, then further data may be processed in
              accordance with the agreement with the respective Conference
              Provider.
            </p>
            <p>
              Logging and recording: If text entries, participation results
              (e.g. from surveys) as well as video or audio recordings are
              recorded, this will be transparently communicated to the
              participants in advance and they will be asked - if necessary -
              for their consent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data protection measures of the participants: Please refer to the
              data privacy information of the Conference Platforms for details
              on the processing of your data and select the optimum security and
              data privacy settings for you within the framework of the settings
              of the conference platforms. Furthermore, please ensure data and
              privacy protection in the background of your recording for the
              duration of a Conference (e.g., by notifying roommates, locking
              doors, and using the background masking function, if technically
              possible). Links to the conference rooms as well as access data,
              should not be passed on to unauthorized third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              Notes on legal bases: Insofar as, in addition to the Conference
              Platforms, we also process users' data and ask users for their
              consent to use contents from the Conferences or certain functions
              (e.g. consent to a recording of Conferences), the legal basis of
              the processing is this consent. Furthermore, our processing may be
              necessary for the fulfillment of our contractual obligations (e.g.
              in participant lists, in the case of reprocessing of Conference
              results, etc.). Otherwise, user data is processed on the basis of
              our legitimate interests in efficient and secure communication
              with our communication partners.

            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              We use Internet-accessible software services (so-called "cloud
              services", also referred to as "Software as a Service") provided
              on the servers of its providers for the following purposes:
              document storage and administration, calendar management, e-mail
              delivery, spreadsheets and presentations, exchange of documents,
              content and information with specific recipients or publication of
              websites, forms or other content and information, as well as chats
              and participation in audio and video conferences.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              Within this framework, personal data may be processed and stored
              on the provider's servers insofar as this data is part of
              communication processes with us or is otherwise processed by us in
              accordance with this privacy policy. This data may include in
              particular master data and contact data of data subjects, data on
              processes, contracts, other proceedings and their contents. Cloud
              service providers also process usage data and metadata that they
              use for security and service optimization purposes.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              If we use cloud services to provide documents and content to other
              users or publicly accessible websites, forms, etc., providers may
              store cookies on users' devices for web analysis or to remember
              user settings (e.g. in the case of media control).
            </p>

            <p>
              Information on legal basis - If we ask for permission to use cloud
              services, the legal basis for processing data is consent.
              Furthermore, their use can be a component of our (pre)contractual
              services, provided that the use of cloud services has been agreed
              in this context. Otherwise, user data will be processed on the
              basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient and
              secure administrative and collaboration processes).

              Double opt-in procedure: The registration to our newsletter takes
              place in general in a so-called Double-Opt-In procedure. This
              means that you will receive an e-mail after registration asking
              you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary
              so that no one can register with external e-mail addresses.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              The registrations for the newsletter are logged in order to be
              able to prove the registration process according to the legal
              requirements. This includes storing the login and confirmation
              times as well as the IP address. Likewise the changes of your data
              stored with the dispatch service provider are logged.

              Deletion and restriction of processing: We may store the
              unsubscribed email addresses for up to three years based on our
              legitimate interests before deleting them to provide evidence of
              prior consent. The processing of these data is limited to the
              purpose of a possible defense against claims. An individual
              deletion request is possible at any time, provided that the former
              existence of a consent is confirmed at the same time. In the case
              of an obligation to permanently observe an objection, we reserve
              the right to store the e-mail address solely for this purpose in a
              blocklist.

              Information on legal bases: The sending of the newsletter is based
              on the consent of the recipients or, if consent is not required,
              on the basis of our legitimate interests in direct marketing.
              Insofar as we engage a service provider for sending e-mails, this
              is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in efficient and
              secure dispatch. The registration procedure is recorded on the
              basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of demonstrating
              that it has been conducted in accordance with the law.

                Measurement of opening rates and click rates: The newsletters
                contain a so-called "web-beacon", i.e. a pixel-sized file, which
                is retrieved from our server when the newsletter is opened or,
                if we use a mailing service provider, from its server. Within
                the scope of this retrieval, technical information such as
                information about the browser and your system, as well as your
                IP address and time of retrieval are first collected. This
                information is used for the technical improvement of our
                newsletter on the basis of technical data or target groups and
                their reading behaviour on the basis of their retrieval points
                (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or
                access times. This analysis also includes determining whether
                newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are
                clicked. This information is assigned to the individual
                newsletter recipients and stored in their profiles until the
                profiles are deleted. The evaluations serve us much more to
                recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our
                content to them or to send different content according to the
                interests of our users. The measurement of opening rates and
                click rates as well as the storage of the measurement results in
                the profiles of the users and their further processing are based
                on the consent of the users. A separate objection to the
                performance measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this
                case the entire newsletter subscription must be cancelled or
                objected to. In this case, the stored profile information will
                be deleted.

            <p>
              Web analysis is used to evaluate the visitor traffic on our
              website and may include the behaviour, interests or demographic
              information of users, such as age or gender, as pseudonymous
              values. With the help of web analysis we can e.g. recognize, at
              which time our online services or their functions or contents are
              most frequently used or requested for repeatedly, as well as which
              areas require optimization.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to web analysis, we can also use test procedures, e.g.
              to test and optimize different versions of our online services or
              their components.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unless otherwise stated below, profiles, i.e. data aggregated for
              a usage process, can be created for these purposes and information
              can be stored in a browser or in a terminal device and read from
              it. The information collected includes, in particular, websites
              visited and elements used there as well as technical information
              such as the browser used, the computer system used and information
              on usage times. If users have agreed to the collection of their
              location data from us or from the providers of the services we
              use, location data may also be processed.

              Unless otherwise stated below, profiles, that is data summarized
              for a usage process or user, may be created for these purposes and
              stored in a browser or terminal device (so-called "cookies") or
              similar processes may be used for the same purpose. The
              information collected includes, in particular, websites visited
              and elements used there as well as technical information such as
              the browser used, the computer system used and information on
              usage times. If users have consented to the collection of their
              location data or profiles to us or to the providers of the
              services we use, these may also be processed, depending on the

              The IP addresses of the users are also stored. However, we use any
              existing IP masking procedure (i.e. pseudonymisation by shortening
              the IP address) to protect the user. In general, within the
              framework of web analysis, A/B testing and optimisation, no user
              data (such as e-mail addresses or names) is stored, but
              pseudonyms. This means that we, as well as the providers of the
              software used, do not know the actual identity of the users, but
              only the information stored in their profiles for the purposes of
              the respective processes.

              component of our (pre)contractual services, provided that the use
              of the third party was agreed within this context. Otherwise, user
              data will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests

              services). In this context, we would also like to refer you to the

                or information regarding their interaction with the apps
                (so-called "cloud computing"). Google Firebase also offers

              for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user
              profiles can be created on the basis of user behaviour and the
              associated interests of users. The user profiles can then be used,
              for example, to place advertisements within and outside the
              networks which are presumed to correspond to the interests of the
              users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the
              user's computer, in which the user's usage behaviour and interests
              are stored. Furthermore, data can be stored in the user profiles
              independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the
              users are members of the respective networks or will become
              members later on).

              effectively pursued with the providers. Only the providers have
              access to the data of the users and can directly take appropriate

                Meta Platforms Ireland Limited for the collection (but not the
                further processing) of data of visitors to our Facebook page.
                This data includes information about the types of content users
                view or interact with, or the actions they take (see "Things
                that you and others do and provide" in the Facebook Data Policy:

                to provide analytics services, known as "page insights," to site
                operators to help them understand how people interact with their
                pages and with content associated with them. We have concluded a

                Facebook must observe and in which Facebook has agreed to
                fulfill the rights of the persons concerned (i.e. users can send
                information access or deletion requests directly to Facebook).
                The rights of users (in particular to access to information,
                erasure, objection and complaint to the competent supervisory
                authority) are not restricted by the agreements with Facebook.

            <p>
              Within our online services, we integrate functional and content
              elements that are obtained from the servers of their respective
              providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers").
              These may, for example, be graphics, videos or city maps
              (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "Content").
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              The integration always presupposes that the third-party providers
              of this content process the IP address of the user, since they
              could not send the content to their browser without the IP
              address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation
              of these contents or functions. We strive to use only those
              contents, whose respective offerers use the IP address only for
              the distribution of the contents. Third parties may also use
              so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web
              beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags"
              can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the
              pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be
              stored in cookies on the user's device and may include technical
              information about the browser and operating system, referring
              websites, visit times and other information about the use of our

            <h2><strong>Terminology and Definitions</strong></h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>
              This section provides an overview of the terms used in this
              privacy policy. Many of the terms are drawn from the law and
              defined mainly in Article 4 GDPR. The legal definitions are
              binding. The following explanations, on the other hand, are
              intended above all for the purpose of comprehension. The terms are
              sorted alphabetically.
            </p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <ul role="list">
              <li>
                Controller: "Controller" means the natural or legal person,
                public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly
                with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing
                of personal data.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                Personal Data: "personal data" means any information relating to
                an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject");
                an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,
                directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
                identifier such as a name, an identification number, location
                data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to
                the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural
                or social identity of that natural person.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                Processing: The term "processing" covers a wide range and
                practically every handling of data, be it collection,
                evaluation, storage, transmission or erasure.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                Profiles with user-related information: The processing of
                "profiles with user-related information", or "profiles" for
                short, includes any kind of automated processing of personal
                data that consists of using these personal data to analyse,
                evaluate or predict certain personal aspects relating to a
                natural person (depending on the type of profiling, this may
                include different information concerning demographics, behaviour
                and interests, such as interaction with websites and their
                content, etc.) (e.g. interests in certain content or products,
                click behaviour on a website or location). Cookies and web
                beacons are often used for profiling purposes.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                Remarketing: Remarketing" or "retargeting" is the term used, for
                example, to indicate for advertising purposes which products a
                user is interested in on a website in order to remind the user
                of these products on other websites, e.g. in
                advertisements.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                Server monitoring and error detection: With the help of server
                monitoring and error detection, we ensure the availability and
                integrity of our online service and use the data processed in
                this process to technically optimise our online services. For
                this purpose, performance, utilization and comparable technical
                values, which provide information about the stability and any
                conspicuous features of our online offer, are processed. In the
                event of errors and irregularities, individual requests from
                users of our online services are recorded in order to identify
                and eliminate sources of problems.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                Web Analytics: Web Analytics serves the evaluation of visitor
                traffic of online services and can determine their behavior or
                interests in certain information, such as content of websites.
                With the help of web analytics, website owners, for example, can
                recognize at what time visitors visit their website and what
                content they are interested in. This allows them, for example,
                to optimize the content of the website to better meet the needs
                of their visitors. For purposes of web analytics, pseudonymous
                cookies and web beacons are frequently used in order to
                recognise returning visitors and thus obtain more precise
                analyses of the use of an online service.
